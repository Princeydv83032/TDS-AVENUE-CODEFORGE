I completed a Sales Prediction project using Python, applying machine learning techniques to forecast product sales based on factors such as advertising expenditure,
target audience segmentation, and platform selection. This project allowed me to analyze data effectively and assist businesses in optimizing their advertising strategies to maximize sales potential.
Here's a breakdown:

Dataset Summary:

The dataset contains information on TV, Radio, and Newspaper advertising spend and corresponding sales data for 200 observations.
Summary statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and quartiles are provided for each feature.
Model Prediction:

You used a machine learning model (likely a linear regression or similar model) to predict sales (res = model.predict(x_test)).
The sample predictions you printed are [10.93127621, 9.88042193, 12.09159447, ...].
Sample Calculation:

It appears that one of the predictions (10.931275958) was derived using a formula like:
0.05473199
×
69.2
+
7.14382225
=
10.931275958
0.05473199×69.2+7.14382225=10.931275958
This indicates that the model is likely using a simple linear equation with the coefficient 
0.05473199
0.05473199 for one feature (e.g., TV spend of 69.2) and an intercept of 
7.14382225
7.14382225.
